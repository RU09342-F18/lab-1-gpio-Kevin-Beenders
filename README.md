# Lab 1: Blink an LED and you can control the world!     
This Lab is meant to allow the participants to learn basics of how to program and build circuits that interact with microcontrollers. For this lab, it involves blinking on and off LEDs that turn on and off by themselves or due to some external stimuli. For example, the simple, multiple and off board blink examples are all coded to turn on and off after programmed intervals. The button blink will turn on and off an LED after a button on the microcontroller is pressed. This lab provides insight into most of the material that makes embedded programming difficult, including port addressing, selecting inputs and outputs and circuit design for use in conjunction with microcontrollers.
