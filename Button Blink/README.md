# Button Blink Kevin Beenders
This folder contrains code for making an LED turn on and off at the users discretion via a button on the microcontroller. When the button is pressed, the led will either turn on or off based on its previous state. A pull down resistor is connected to the button in order to release residual charge stored in the pin that could cause the button to flicker otherwise.
