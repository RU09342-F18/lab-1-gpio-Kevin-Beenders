# Button Blink Kevin Beenders
This folder contrains code for making an LED turn on and off at the users discretion via a button on the microcontroller. When the button is pressed, the led will either turn on or off based on its previous state. A pull down resistor is connected to the button in order to release residual charge stored in the pin that could cause the button to flicker otherwise. Since we are using the delay cycles function, the button status will refresh after a certain amount of clock cycles. Also, If the button is continuously held down, the led will behave as if it does in the simple blink example. When the button is pressed faster than the fewuency of the while loop completion time, the pressing of the button will be unresponsive to any pressing.
