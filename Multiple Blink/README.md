# Multiple Blink
This directory contains files for the G2253 and the F5529 microcontrollers in order to blink two LEDs on the board at different rates. The code is similar to the simple blink as in it toggles on and off after a certain amount of cycles. However, these files also contains two if statements nested in the while loop. What this does is blink the LED once the integers A for the first LED and B for the second LED respectively equal a certain value. This value increases after every iteration of the while loop.
